Crop Name,Description
Rice,"Rice is one of the most important staple crops in India, feeding millions of people daily. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires specific growing conditions for optimal yield. 
GROWING PROCESS: Rice cultivation begins with land preparation through plowing and leveling. Seeds are either directly sown or transplanted as seedlings after 20-25 days in nursery beds. Transplanting is preferred as it allows better weed control and water management. The crop goes through four main growth stages: vegetative (tillering), reproductive (panicle initiation), flowering, and grain filling.
WATER REQUIREMENTS: Rice is a water-intensive crop requiring 1200-1500mm of water throughout its lifecycle. Fields must be kept flooded with 2-5 inches of standing water during most of the growing period. Proper drainage is essential 10-15 days before harvest. Alternate wetting and drying techniques can save water while maintaining yields.
SUNLIGHT REQUIREMENTS: Rice requires full sunlight, needing 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. It grows best in temperatures between 20-35°C. The crop is sensitive to temperature extremes during flowering stage.
SOIL REQUIREMENTS: Clay or clay-loam soils with good water retention capacity are ideal. Soil pH should range between 5.5-7.0. The field must be able to retain water without excessive seepage.
DURATION: The crop matures in 120-150 days depending on the variety. Early maturing varieties take 90-110 days while long-duration varieties need 150-160 days.
FERTILIZER NEEDS: Rice requires balanced NPK fertilization. Apply nitrogen in split doses - basal, tillering, and panicle initiation stages. Phosphorus and potassium should be applied as basal dose during field preparation."


Wheat,"Wheat is a crucial rabi crop and the second most important staple food in India. It's grown primarily in northern and central regions during the winter season.
GROWING PROCESS: Sowing begins after the monsoon season in October-November when temperatures drop. Seeds are sown using seed drill or broadcast method at 2-3 inch depth with row spacing of 20-23 cm. Germination occurs within 5-7 days. The crop undergoes crown root initiation, tillering, stem elongation, heading, and grain filling stages.
WATER REQUIREMENTS: Wheat requires 450-650mm of water during its entire growth period. It needs 4-6 irrigations depending on soil type and climate. Critical irrigation stages include crown root initiation (20-25 days after sowing), tillering, flowering, and grain filling stages. Proper drainage prevents waterlogging which can damage roots.
SUNLIGHT REQUIREMENTS: Wheat needs full sun exposure with 6-8 hours of bright sunlight daily. It grows optimally in temperatures between 10-25°C. Cool nights and warm days during grain filling enhance quality and yield.
SOIL REQUIREMENTS: Well-drained loamy soils with good organic matter content are best. Soil pH should range from 6.0-7.5. Heavy clay soils with poor drainage should be avoided as wheat is sensitive to waterlogging.
DURATION: The crop matures in 110-130 days for early varieties and 130-150 days for late-maturing varieties. Timely sowing is crucial for achieving maximum yields.
FERTILIZER NEEDS: Apply nitrogen in three splits - half at sowing, one-fourth at first irrigation (21 days), and remaining at second irrigation (40-45 days). Phosphorus and potassium should be applied at the time of sowing. Zinc application is beneficial in deficient soils."

Cotton,"Cotton is a major cash crop and fiber crop in India, providing raw material for the textile industry. It's grown as a kharif crop in tropical and subtropical regions.
GROWING PROCESS: Seeds are sown in rows with spacing of 60-90 cm between rows and 30-60 cm between plants. Germination occurs in 5-10 days. The plant develops vegetative branches and fruiting branches. Square formation (flower buds) begins 35-40 days after sowing, followed by flowering and boll development. Bolls mature and burst open revealing cotton fiber.
WATER REQUIREMENTS: Cotton requires 700-1300mm of water throughout the season. It needs moderate but regular water supply. Critical irrigation stages include germination, flowering, and boll development. The crop is drought-tolerant during vegetative stage but sensitive to moisture stress during flowering and boll formation. Over-irrigation causes excessive vegetative growth at the expense of fruiting.
SUNLIGHT REQUIREMENTS: Cotton is a sun-loving crop requiring 7-8 hours of bright sunlight daily. It thrives in temperatures between 21-30°C. Warm days and cool nights favor fiber quality. High humidity increases pest and disease problems.
SOIL REQUIREMENTS: Deep, well-drained black cotton soils or alluvial soils are ideal. Soil pH should range from 5.8-8.0, with 6.5-7.5 being optimal. Good soil aeration is essential for root development.
DURATION: Cotton takes 150-180 days to mature. Multiple pickings are done at 15-20 day intervals as bolls mature at different times.
FERTILIZER NEEDS: Apply nitrogen in splits at sowing, square formation, and flowering. Phosphorus and potassium boost boll formation and fiber quality. Micronutrients like zinc and boron are essential for good yields."
