        "description": """Rice is one of the most important staple crops in India, feeding millions of people daily. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires specific growing conditions for optimal yield.
        
GROWING PROCESS: Rice cultivation begins with land preparation through plowing and leveling. Seeds are either directly sown or transplanted as seedlings after 20-25 days in nursery beds. Transplanting is preferred as it allows better weed control and water management. The crop goes through four main growth stages: vegetative (tillering), reproductive (panicle initiation), flowering, and grain filling.

WATER REQUIREMENTS: Rice is a water-intensive crop requiring 1200-1500mm of water throughout its lifecycle. Fields must be kept flooded with 2-5 inches of standing water during most of the growing period. Proper drainage is essential 10-15 days before harvest. Alternate wetting and drying techniques can save water while maintaining yields.

SUNLIGHT REQUIREMENTS: Rice requires full sunlight, needing 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. It grows best in temperatures between 20-35¬∞C. The crop is sensitive to temperature extremes during flowering stage.

SOIL REQUIREMENTS: Clay or clay-loam soils with good water retention capacity are ideal. Soil pH should range between 5.5-7.0. The field must be able to retain water without excessive seepage.

DURATION: The crop matures in 120-150 days depending on the variety. Early maturing varieties take 90-110 days while long-duration varieties need 150-160 days.
